    <p>
      A myriad of public decisions are made each year that affect the quality
      of our lives, the health of our biosphere, and the welfare of future
      generations. Regrettably, these decisions are often made without our
      participation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Metagovernment is a community of people who are exploring and
      developing various technologies that would allow citizens to be
      directly involved in the discussions and decisions that affect
      them most.
    </p>
    <p>
      We explore, challenge, and collaborate with each other in the
      development of various ideas and technologies for these new
      governance systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our forum is uniquely neutral ground. We enjoy an abundance of
      visions which often makes for very lively discussions.
